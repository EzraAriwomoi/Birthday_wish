## Wish Happy Birthday

This Python script uses the `turtle` graphics library to create a festive birthday card. The code is designed to draw a series of concentric layers with different colors and add celebratory text to create a vibrant birthday greeting.

### Features

- **Layered Circles**: The script draws multiple concentric circles in various colors to create a visually appealing birthday cake-like effect.
- **Text**: The text "HAPPY", "BIRTHDAY", and "TO YOU" is written in bold fonts with different colors, adding a personalized touch to the card.
- **Decorative Elements**: Additional decorations include a series of filled circles arranged in a star-like pattern at the top of the card and a celebratory "JOY" message.

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: The `turtle` screen is set to a pink background.
2. **Draw Layers**: 
   - The `draw_layer` function is used to draw concentric colored circles at specified positions.
   - Colors and radii are defined for each layer to create a layered effect.
3. **Draw Text**: 
   - The `draw_text` function is used to place text at specified positions with specified colors.
4. **Decorations**:
   - The script draws a star-like pattern using the turtle's `circle` method.
   - A final message "JOY" is displayed at the top of the card.
   
### Usage

Run this script in a Python environment that supports `turtle` graphics. The script will open a window displaying the birthday card, which includes colorful layers and celebratory text.

### Customization

You can modify the colors, text, and positions by adjusting the parameters in the `draw_layer` and `draw_text` functions. Experiment with different settings to create your own unique birthday card design.

Enjoy spreading birthday cheer with this festive turtle graphics script!
